# savingFigures_matlabPython

Saving figures and gifs in Python and MATLAB. [Documentation](https://tulimid1.github.io/savingfig2/)

This repository holds functions that I use to save figures when doing analysis. These functions are meant to help organize figures and make the saving process easier. 

The `Using_SaveFiles.ipynb` and `Using_SaveFiles.mlx` are tutorial notebooks.
